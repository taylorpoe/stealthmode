A Famous Framework component

- - - -


## Live Demo
Visit the [live demo here](http://colortheory.io/stealth)

## Context
Project was made simply to familiarize myself with the new [Famous Framework](http://famous.org/framework/) (currently in Alpha).

## Setup

First install the required packages:

    $ npm install

This step will also copy some core Famous components (e.g. `famous:core:node` and `famous:events` into your project's directory.)

Then start up the local development server:

    $ npm run dev

Then surf to [localhost:1618](http://localhost:1618) ...

## Deploying

Once you're ready to deploy your component, run

    $ famous deploy
